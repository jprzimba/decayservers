[ ACTION IDS
	ActionID's are ID's that you can place on things using a MapEditor or a LUA
	script, ActionID's can be set on more than one item, it is not unique.

	30001
		.../data/movements/scripts/firstitems.lua
			ActionID on tile that gives player his/her first items on
			the first login, normally this ActionID is set as 3x3 around
			the start temple position.

	30021 - 30030
		.../data/movements/scripts/citizen.lua
			ActionID on teleport which will change the players town id
			(player will appear in the temple of this town on death),
			normally this ActionID is set on teleports which lead to
			the temple.

			TownID to 1 when the player walks in a teleport then you set
			the ActionID of the teleport to 30021.
