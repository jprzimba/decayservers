[ GUIDE
	Linux
		Introduction
			In this guide you will learn how to setup a MySQL server
			and TheForgottenServer database on it, on linux this is
			a simple task.

		#1
			Launch a terminal if you're running Desktop mode.

		#2
			To complete this step you need to know what repository
			package downloader you are using, in Debian or any
			debian based distribution (Ubuntu for example), the
			available repository package downloaders are:
				apt-get
				aptitude

			In CentOS, hopefully in Red Hat too, it is:
				yum

			Now type this command, and remember to replace rpd with
			your repository package downloader.
				rpd install mysql-server-5.0

		#3
			You should now have a MySQL Server installed, it is time
			to create a database, for this, we first have to get to
			the MySQL commandline.
				mysql -uroot -p

			It should ask you for a password, if you can not remember
			that you have any password for MySQL set, then leave the
			password field empty.

		#4
			We will now create the database, to do this type:
				CREATE DATABASE theforgottenserver;

			If you want another databasename then replace
			theforgottenserver with another name you prefer.

		#5
			Now that we have a database created it is time to import
			all tables and triggers, closedown the MySQL commandline
			cd (change directory) to TheForgottenServer one, and type:
				mysql -uroot -p theforgottenserver < schemas/mysql.sql

			If you changed database name then also remember to change
			'theforgottenserver' to your database name there.

		#6
			Now you should have a MySQL server with TheForgottenServer
			database imported, it is time to open config.lua with your
			favourite text editor and go to the '-- MySQL' part. Edit
			the settings there for the server to be able to create a
			successful MySQL connection.

		#7
			Don't close config.lua yet, if you already did, open it
			again find the '-- SQL' part and change sqlType to "mysql".
			You may now save and close config.lua.

		#8
			Last step, you can now launch your server ;).
			If you're new to Linux you just have to type:
				./TheForgottenServer

	Windows
		Introduction
			In this guide you will learn how to setup a MySQL server
			and TheForgottenServer database on it, you will also get
			some other things with this, such as Apache2 and PHP5
			because we're going to use XAMPP to make this an easy
			task, Apache2 and PHP5 are quite useful anyway if you
			plan on launching a website for your project.

		#1
			Download XAMPP from:
				http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/xampp/xampp-win32-1.6.6a-installer.exe

		#2
			Go to http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php and change your root password.

		#3
			Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and login as root and with your new password.

		#4
			Create a database, name it whatever you want.

		#5
			Enter your database and press on 'Import'.

		#6
			Use the 'File to import' part, select mysql.sql and press on 'Go'.

		#7
			Now you should have a MySQL server with TheForgottenServer
			database imported, it is time to open config.lua with your
			favourite text editor and go to the '-- MySQL' part. Edit
			the settings there for the server to be able to create a
			successful MySQL connection.

		#8
			Don't close config.lua yet, if you already did, open it
			again find the '-- SQL' part and change sqlType to "mysql".
			You may now save and close config.lua.
