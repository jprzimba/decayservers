# Decay Servers
Decay Servers are modified servers, originally based on more recent versions of Tibia at the time the projects were initiated.

Currently, there are two servers: The Forgotten Server 0.2, which has been decayed to version 7.9, and 0.3, which has been decayed to version 8.0.

If you like the project, feel free to contribute with a pull request, and we will continue to keep the project updated.
