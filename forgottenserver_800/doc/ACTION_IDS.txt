	[ Actionid 100
		There are a few items which can have special usage.
		For example, sand floor can be openable with a shovel if actionid 100 is set (without actionid it works in an ordinary way)

		Enchanting (Items IDs may be found in 'lib/constant.lua' file - 'enchantingAltars')
			Set actionid on all of the altar parts to make the enchanting work

		Desert holes (Items: 231, 9059)
			Openable with a shovel (like tombs in global Tibia)

		Draw Well (Item: 1369)
			It teleports player 1 floor down (like room to the Fibula Dungeon in global Tibia)
